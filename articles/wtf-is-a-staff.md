# What Being a Staff iOS Engineer Actually Means

After two years as a Staff iOS Engineer at Yassir, a fast-growing mobility super app operating across multiple markets, I realized that the hardest part of the role was not the technical complexity. It was the lack of a shared definition.

Most people do not really know what a Staff engineer is supposed to do. That includes Senior engineers, managers, and sometimes even other Staff engineers.

This becomes obvious when Senior engineers start asking questions like whether they should learn a new framework, pick up another language, or specialize harder in a specific area. Those questions are reasonable, but they often miss the point entirely.

I am writing this because I kept seeing the same confusion repeated. People were trying to optimize for the Staff title without understanding what actually changes when you get there.

## The Role Is Vague on Purpose

> In *The Staff Engineer’s Path*, Tanya Reilly makes a point that perfectly matches reality: nobody fully agrees on what a Staff engineer does. The role is intentionally underdefined.

That ambiguity is not a failure. It is the system working as intended. Staff engineers are meant to operate where problems are not cleanly scoped, where ownership is fuzzy, and where the org chart stops being useful.

If someone sells you a neat “Staff Engineer roadmap” with guaranteed steps, they are lying.

### Expectations Vary Wildly, Even Inside the Same Company

Even within Yassir, expectations for Staff iOS engineers varied significantly depending on the Head of Engineering and the teams involved. My relationship with my teams was not the same as what was expected from other Staff engineers.

Some leaders expected Staff engineers to attend every scrum, every planning session, every recurring ritual. I strongly disagree with that approach.

Staff engineers are expensive, and their time is limited. Filling their calendars with meetings that do not create leverage is a poor tradeoff. Presence does not equal impact.

In practice, I stayed aligned through written design docs, RFC reviews, async discussions, and targeted one-on-ones with key stakeholders. That created far more value than sitting in every ceremony.

This is an important thing to understand if you are aiming for Staff. You are not stepping into a standardized role. You are stepping into a negotiated one, shaped by trust, leadership style, and the actual problems the company is facing.

### Staff Is Not About Being the Best iOS Developer

One of the biggest misconceptions is that becoming Staff means being the strongest Swift or iOS engineer in the room.

It does not.

Staff is not about knowing every Apple API, solving the most tickets, or acting as a tech lead with a shinier title. If your sense of value is still tied to raw output, the role will feel uncomfortable very quickly.

That discomfort is not a failure. It is a signal that the job has changed.

### From Shipping Code to Shaping the Team

My biggest impact at Yassir was not a specific feature or technical system. It was shaping the team itself.

A large part of my role revolved around hiring, defining what “good” looks like, and raising engineering standards. Over time, I participated in more than 70 interviews and helped hire around 10 engineers. That forced me to be extremely explicit about expectations, tradeoffs, and the type of engineers we wanted to build the organization around.

Raising the bar also meant facing uncomfortable realities. Defining strong standards inevitably reveals who is not meeting them. I was directly involved in difficult discussions around underperformance, providing the technical context and evidence that led the management team to let 3 engineers go.

Those moments were emotionally heavy, but necessary for the long-term health of the team. When I left, I left behind a capable, self-sufficient group of engineers with strong fundamentals and a shared sense of quality. That mattered far more to me than any single technical contribution.

### Code Quality, Architecture, and Mentality

Beyond hiring, my focus was on code quality, architectural consistency, and engineering mentality.

Staff work often looks invisible from the outside. It is the slow compounding effect of better reviews, clearer tradeoffs, cleaner abstractions, and engineers who think in terms of systems instead of tickets.

These things rarely show up in sprint metrics, but they shape everything that follows.

### Breadth, Depth, and Accepting Your Shape

There is a persistent myth that Staff engineers must know everything. That is neither realistic nor desirable.

I think about this through the lens of T-shaped skills. Broad foundational knowledge across the stack, paired with deep expertise in specific areas.

Personally, my strengths are in networking, architecture, and system-level thinking. I love design and animation, and I enjoy working in tools like Figma, but UI implementation is not where I add the most value. My background is rooted in UIKit, while our codebase was largely SwiftUI. I learned it deeply enough to make sound architectural decisions, not to master animations or visual polish. That work was already being done exceptionally well by Senior engineers who were better suited for it.

That is fine.

Teams benefit from Staff engineers with different shapes. Uniformity is not the goal.

### Frameworks Are Usually the Wrong Focus

When Senior engineers ask what they should learn next, I often think the better question is: what problems keep repeating, and why?

This is why seeing a CV with "Senior" or "Staff" next to only three years of total experience is such a disconnect from reality. It is a red flag, not an achievement.

You can learn a framework in a month. You can memorize design patterns in a week. But you cannot speed-run the experience of living with your own bad decisions.

Real seniority comes from the long feedback loop of building something, releasing it, watching it break, and having to fix it six months later when the requirements have changed. If you have only been working for three years, you simply haven’t stuck around long enough to see how your "clean architecture" actually handles the messiness of real-world scale.

Staff growth is not about stacking tools or chasing trends. It is about stacking context. That context comes from time, exposure, and the scars of past mistakes.

Some of that simply cannot be accelerated.

### Why You Want to Be Staff Matters

Once you realize that Staff is about context and leverage, you have to ask yourself why you actually want the role.

If it is for money, you do not need the Staff title. You can make excellent money as a Senior iOS engineer. In my upcoming role, I will be a Senior iOS Engineer making roughly double what I was making before. Spoiler alert: I resigned from Yassir recently, and will be moving away from Italy but that is a story for another article.

If it is for impact, the title should not matter either. Any healthy organization listens to good ideas regardless of level. Influence can come from writing, mentoring, guilds, internal talks, or speaking at conferences.

If it is for the title itself, be careful. Titles are cheap in bad companies. There are CTOs in companies of five people.

At this stage of my career, I care about growth and compensation. I turned down a Staff role at Glovo because my new role offered more of both without the title. I am completely comfortable with that tradeoff.

### Staff Is Contextual, Not Portable

Being a Staff engineer only makes sense in the context of the company and the problems it is solving.

A Senior engineer at Netflix is likely operating at a higher level than a Staff engineer at a company building a simple to-do app. Domain complexity matters.

Much of my effectiveness at Yassir came from deeply understanding the mobility and payments domain. Move me to a note-taking app, and a large part of that leverage disappears.

Titles do not transfer domain knowledge.

## Closing Thoughts

Staff is not a destination. It is a mode of operation.

If you chase the title, you will likely be disappointed. If you focus on judgment, leverage, and long-term impact, the title may come or it may not. Either way, you will grow.

The title is vague, but the impact should not be.
